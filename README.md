# NullChecker

## Description and background:
When performing data recovery services, sometimes the damage is too significant to fully recover all files.  When that occurs, it often requires a great deal of time examining the recovered data and separating out the files that are damaged to the point of uselessness.
This tool is intended to significantly reduce the time spent on this stage of recovery by automating the process of examining files for damage.  None of the tools currently available are well-suited to this task.
